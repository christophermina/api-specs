# API Specs

A collection of API specifications.

Reasons for building a set of API specifications include:

1. Easily use API tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and [MuleSoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/)
1. [Auto-generate SDKs](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)
1. Create [API Explorers](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) when permitted

Some specifications are provided by API providers and others are built manually from documentation.
