# API Specs

A collection of API specifications.

Reasons for building a set of API specifications include:

1. Easily use API tools like Postman and MuleSoft
1. Auto-generate SDKs
1. Create API Explorers when permitted

Some specifications are provided by API providers and others are built manually from documentation.
